# INVISIBLE ARMOR

Formerly "ShowSkin"

Show your skin proudly to everyone without losing armor benefits

- your armor is taken away and kept in a safe place in the world
- if some damage occurs that armor can mitigate, it is worn briefly and stored again
- damage mitigations are recalculated (HideArmor doesnt)

this plugin is under development and have no bukkit project page yet, see "changelog.txt" file inside source
